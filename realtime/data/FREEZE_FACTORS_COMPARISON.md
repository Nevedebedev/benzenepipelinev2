# February 2021 Freeze Event - Factor Comparison Analysis

## Executive Summary

The February 2021 freeze events were caused by **STABLE METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS**, specifically **very low diffusion coefficients** that led to poor atmospheric mixing and accumulation of benzene near emission sources.

## Key Finding

**The primary factor was DIFFUSION COEFFICIENT, not wind speed or emissions.**

## Detailed Comparison

### 2019 Hazards (Top 10 Events)
- **EDF Peak Range**: 48.03 - 196.94 ppb
- **Wind Speed**: 2.68 m/s average (range: 0.85 - 4.95 m/s)
- **Diffusion Coefficient**: 20.17 m²/s average (range: 1.46 - 53.67 m²/s)
- **Emission Rate**: 0.000672 kg/s average (range: 0.000322 - 0.001095 kg/s)

### 2021 Freeze Events (Feb 11-20)
- **EDF Peak Range**: 0.24 - 24.22 ppb
- **Wind Speed**: 3.42 m/s average (range: 2.64 - 5.00 m/s)
- **Diffusion Coefficient**: 7.30 m²/s average (range: 5.51 - 11.18 m²/s)
- **Emission Rate**: 0.000585 kg/s average (range: 0.000322 - 0.001095 kg/s)

## Factor-by-Factor Analysis

### 1. Wind Speed
- **2021 Freeze**: 3.42 m/s (actually HIGHER than 2019)
- **2019 Hazards**: 2.68 m/s
- **Difference**: +27.7% higher in 2021
- **Conclusion**: Wind speed was NOT the limiting factor. The freeze had slightly higher wind speeds than 2019 hazards.

### 2. Diffusion Coefficient ⚠️ **PRIMARY FACTOR**
- **2021 Freeze**: 7.30 m²/s (VERY LOW)
- **2019 Hazards**: 20.17 m²/s
- **Difference**: **-63.8% lower in 2021**
- **Conclusion**: This is the **KEY FACTOR**. The freeze period had dramatically lower diffusion coefficients, indicating:
  - Poor atmospheric mixing
  - Stable atmospheric conditions
  - Limited vertical mixing
  - Pollutants trapped near ground level

### 3. Emission Rates
- **2021 Freeze**: 0.000585 kg/s
- **2019 Hazards**: 0.000672 kg/s
- **Difference**: -13.0% (slightly lower, but similar)
- **Conclusion**: Emissions were **NORMAL** during the freeze. No evidence of elevated emissions or accidents.

### 4. Combined Effect: Dispersion Index

**Dispersion Index = Wind Speed × Diffusion Coefficient**

- **2021 Freeze**: 24.95 (m/s × m²/s)
- **2019 Hazards**: 53.99 (m/s × m²/s)
- **Difference**: **-53.8% lower dispersion capacity**

This combined metric shows that despite having slightly higher wind speeds, the freeze period had **much lower overall dispersion capacity** due to the extremely low diffusion coefficients.

## Why Diffusion Coefficient Matters

The diffusion coefficient (D) represents the rate at which pollutants mix in the atmosphere:

- **High D (>20 m²/s)**: Good mixing, pollutants disperse quickly
- **Medium D (10-20 m²/s)**: Moderate mixing
- **Low D (5-10 m²/s)**: Poor mixing, pollutants accumulate
- **Very Low D (<5 m²/s)**: Very poor mixing, high concentrations near sources

During the freeze:
- Average D = 7.30 m²/s (in the "poor mixing" range)
- All events had D < 11.18 m²/s (all in poor/very poor mixing range)
- This is 63.8% lower than typical hazard conditions

## Atmospheric Stability During Freeze

The low diffusion coefficients indicate **stable atmospheric conditions**:

1. **Temperature Inversions**: Cold air trapped near surface
2. **Limited Vertical Mixing**: Pollutants cannot disperse upward
3. **Horizontal Accumulation**: Pollutants accumulate in a shallow layer
4. **Extended Exposure**: High concentrations persist longer

## Comparison with 2019 Hazards

| Factor | 2019 Hazards | 2021 Freeze | Difference |
|--------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| **EDF Peak** | 48-197 ppb | 0.24-24 ppb | Lower in 2021 |
| **Wind Speed** | 2.68 m/s | 3.42 m/s | +27.7% higher |
| **Diffusion** | 20.17 m²/s | 7.30 m²/s | **-63.8% lower** |
| **Emission** | 0.000672 kg/s | 0.000585 kg/s | -13.0% lower |
| **Dispersion Index** | 53.99 | 24.95 | **-53.8% lower** |

## Key Insights

1. **Diffusion coefficient is the primary limiting factor**, not wind speed
2. **Emissions were normal** - no evidence of accidents or elevated releases
3. **Stable atmospheric conditions** during freeze led to poor mixing
4. **Lower overall concentrations** in 2021 compared to 2019, but still elevated due to poor dispersion

## Conclusion

The February 2021 freeze events were caused by:

1. ✅ **Very low diffusion coefficients** (63.8% lower than 2019 hazards)
2. ✅ **Stable atmospheric conditions** (poor vertical mixing)
3. ✅ **Normal emission rates** (not elevated)
4. ❌ **NOT caused by low wind speeds** (actually higher than 2019)
5. ❌ **NOT caused by accidents or elevated emissions**

**The freeze created stable atmospheric conditions that trapped pollutants near the ground, leading to elevated concentrations despite normal emission rates and adequate wind speeds.**
