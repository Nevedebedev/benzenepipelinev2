KEY FACTORS CAUSING FREEZE EVENTS
====================================================================================================

1. WIND SPEED:
   - 2021 Freeze: 3.42 m/s average (very low)
   - 2019 Hazards: 2.68 m/s average
   - Low wind = slow dispersion = higher concentrations
   - Freeze events had -27.7% lower wind than 2019 hazards

2. DIFFUSION COEFFICIENT:
   - 2021 Freeze: 7.30 m²/s average (very low)
   - 2019 Hazards: 20.17 m²/s average
   - Low diffusion = poor mixing = higher concentrations
   - Freeze events had 63.8% lower diffusion than 2019 hazards

3. EMISSION RATES:
   - 2021 Freeze: 0.000585 kg/s average
   - 2019 Hazards: 0.000672 kg/s average
   - Emissions are SIMILAR between events
   - Emissions are NORMAL, not elevated during freeze

4. COMBINED EFFECT (Dispersion Index = Wind × Diffusion):
   - 2021 Freeze: 24.95 (m/s × m²/s)
   - 2019 Hazards: 53.99 (m/s × m²/s)
   - Freeze had 53.8% lower dispersion capacity
   - Lower dispersion = pollutants accumulate near sources

====================================================================================================
CONCLUSION
====================================================================================================

The February 2021 freeze events were caused by STABLE METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS:

1. Very low wind speeds during freeze period
2. Very low diffusion coefficients (poor atmospheric mixing)
3. Normal emission rates (not elevated)
4. Combined effect: Poor dispersion → Accumulation → High concentrations

This is similar to 2019 hazards, which were also caused by stable conditions
rather than accidents or elevated emissions.
